# 0x14. MySQL

## General
* What is the main role of a database
* What is a database replica
* What is the purpose of a database replica
* Why database backups need to be stored in different physical locations
* What operation should you regularly perform to make sure that your database backup strategy actually works

# Requirements

### General

* Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
* All your files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* All your files should end with a new line
* A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* All your Bash script files must be executable
* Your Bash script must pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7-5~ubuntu16.04.1 via apt-get) without any error
* The first line of all your Bash scripts should be exactly #!/usr/bin/env bash
* The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

## Tasks

0. Install MySQL mandatory
First things first, let’s get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.

* MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x
* Make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status
* Please make sure you have your README.md pushed to Github.
Example:

``` 
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ mysql --version
mysql  Ver 14.14 Distrib 5.7.25, for Linux (x86_64) using  EditLine wrapper
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$
```


[1. Let us in! mandatory]()

In order for us to verify that your servers are properly configured, we need you to create a user and password for both MySQL databases which will allow the checker access to them.

* Create a MySQL user named holberton_user on both web-01 and web-02 with the host name set to localhost and the password projectcorrection280hbtn. This will allow us to access the replication status on both servers.
* Make sure that holberton_user has permission to check the primary/replica status of your databases.
* In addition to that, make sure that task #3 of your SSH project is completed for web-01 and web-02. You will likely need to add the public key to web-02 as you only added it to web-01 for this project. The checker will connect to your servers to check MySQL status
Example:

```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ mysql -uholberton_user -p -e "SHOW GRANTS FOR 'holberton_user'@'localhost'"
Enter password:
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| Grants for holberton_user@localhost           |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
| GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'holberton_user'@'localhost' |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$
```

[2. If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes]()

In order for you to set up replication, you’ll need to have a database with at least one table and one row in your primary MySQL server (web-01) to replicate from.

* Create a database named tyrell_corp.
* Within the tyrell_corp database create a table named nexus6 and add at least one entry to it.
* Make sure that holberton_user has SELECT permissions on your table so that we can check that the table exists and is not empty.

```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ mysql -uholberton_user -p -e "use tyrell_corp; select * from nexus6"
Enter password:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
|  1 | Leon  |
+----+-------+
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$
```

[3. Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?]()
Before you get started with your primary-replica synchronization, you need one more thing in place. On your primary MySQL server (web-01), create a new user for the replica server.

* The name of the new user should be replica_user, with the host name set to %, and can have whatever password you’d like.
* replica_user must have the appropriate permissions to replicate your primary MySQL server.
* holberton_user will need SELECT privileges on the mysql.user table in order to check that replica_user was created with the correct permissions.

```
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$ mysql -uholberton_user -p -e 'SELECT user, Repl_slave_priv FROM mysql.user'
+------------------+-----------------+
| user             | Repl_slave_priv |
+------------------+-----------------+
| root             | Y               |
| mysql.session    | N               |
| mysql.sys        | N               |
| debian-sys-maint | Y               |
| holberton_user   | N               |
| replica_user     | Y               |
+------------------+-----------------+
ubuntu@229-web-01:~$
```
