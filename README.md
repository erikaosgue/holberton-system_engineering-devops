This is a Project about learning the Shell, about how to navigate in the shell with the commands, how to manipulate files, and How to create a Script
also this repository contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps track at Holberton School. In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing Bash scripts to automate tasks. I learned about the OSI model and various Linux networking tools. Further, I configured a distributed system - two web servers and one load balancer - for deployment of my AirBnB project using Nginx, HAProxy, certbot, ufw, and MySQL.
